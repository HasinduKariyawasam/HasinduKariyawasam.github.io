I am a post-bac fellow affiliated with [Wadduwage lab](https://www.wadduwagelab.com/), Center for Advanced Imaging, Harvard University. My work is mainly focused on physics-based machine learning and computational imaging. My research interests are in physics-based machine learning, mathematical modeling, computational imaging, optical neural networks, deep learning, and signal processing.

At Wadduwage lab, under the supervision of Dr. Dushan Wadduwage, I am working on modeling and training learnable optical systems taking fabrication constraints and noise into consideration. I am also working on modeling optical non-linear activations for learnable optical systems to increase their performance. Before joining Wadduwage lab, I completed my B.Sc. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka (1st class, CGPA: 4.14/4.20, Rank: 2/115). I also worked as a Visiting Researcher (Student) at the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney under the supervision of Dr. Anusha Withana. 

I like to watch movies and travel in my free time. Despite being a terrible player, I enjoy playing cricket and chess.
